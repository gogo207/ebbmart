								<p>It's important to add all of the products in your catalog to your store. Having more products in your store increases your chances of showing up in buyers' search results. This means you'll potentially get more exposure and secure more customers as a result.
								You can post products individually, or streamline the process with the bulk upload tool. As you post products, the Intelligent Posting system uses AI to suggest ways to optimize each listing based on how the  eBobmart.comalgorithm works, and what buyers are searching for on the site.
